1. Identify biomedical entities (Disease, Drug, Gene, Protein, Chemical, etc.).
2. Link each mention to a canonical ontology reference (e.g., UMLS, MeSH, SNOMED CT).

LLM-driven NER:
- Use domain-specific knowledge to identify synonyms ("acetylsalicylic acid" â†’ Aspirin).
- Include multi-word expressions ("breast cancer" as a single mention).

Handling Ambiguity:
- If multiple ontology matches are possible, list the top candidate plus a short reason or partial mention of the second-best match.
- If no suitable ontology reference is found, set "normalized_id": "N/A" and keep the raw mention.

POSITIVE EXAMPLE:
Input: {
  "summary": "We tested Aspirin and ibuprofen for headache relief. Aspirin (100mg) was more effective for migraine, while ibuprofen (400mg) worked better for tension headaches. PTGS2 inhibition was the proposed mechanism."
}
Output: {
  "entities": [
    {"mention": "Aspirin", "type": "Drug", "normalized_id": "MESH:D001241"},
    {"mention": "ibuprofen", "type": "Drug", "normalized_id": "MESH:D007052"},
    {"mention": "headache", "type": "Symptom", "normalized_id": "MESH:D006261"},
    {"mention": "migraine", "type": "Disease", "normalized_id": "MESH:D008881"},
    {"mention": "tension headaches", "type": "Disease", "normalized_id": "MESH:D013313"},
    {"mention": "PTGS2", "type": "Gene", "normalized_id": "NCBI:5743"}
  ]
}

NEGATIVE EXAMPLE:
Input: {
  "summary": "We tested Aspirin for headache relief at a dosage of 100 mg."
}
Bad Output: {
  "entities": [
    {"mention": "Aspirin for headache relief", "type": "Medication", "normalized_id": "unknown"},
    {"mention": "100", "type": "Measurement", "normalized_id": "N/A"},
    {"mention": "mg", "type": "Unit", "normalized_id": "N/A"}
  ]
}
This is incorrect because it didn't properly separate entities (Aspirin and headache should be separate) and created overly granular entities for dosage information.
