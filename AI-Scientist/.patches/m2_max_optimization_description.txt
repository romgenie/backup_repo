M2 Max Performance Optimization
=============================

This patch optimizes the AI-Scientist code for Apple M2 Max hardware with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS).

System Specifications:
- Apple M2 Max (12 cores)
- 32GB RAM
- macOS 24.3.0 Darwin Kernel
- PyTorch 2.6.0 with MPS backend

Key optimizations:
1. Added MPS device support in experiment.py for Apple Silicon
2. Created config_gpu.ini with optimized settings for M2 Max
3. Tuned memory management for 32GB system
4. Configured precision settings for MPS stability (float32)
5. Optimized model architecture for better performance
6. Improved data loading with pinned memory and async transfers
7. Added path flexibility for running from different directories
8. Implemented periodic cache clearing to prevent memory fragmentation
9. Adjusted batch size and gradient accumulation for throughput
10. Reduced model size but increased context window for better efficiency

To apply this patch:
```
git apply m2_max_performance_optimization.patch
```

To revert:
```
git checkout -- templates/nanoGPT/experiment.py templates/nanoGPT_lite/experiment.py config_gpu.ini
```

See performance_changes.md for more details on the optimizations.
