"""Adaptive Graph-Guided Iterative Prompt Calibration (AGGIPC) for GPT-4o-mini on MATH500

This script implements a novel prompting technique that integrates dynamic reasoning graphs with iterative chain-of-thought (CoT) self-correction to improve performance on the 500-question MATH500 benchmark.
The experiment proceeds as follows:
1. For each math problem, GPT-4o-mini is prompted to produce a detailed, numbered chain-of-thought (CoT) with a final answer enclosed in a LaTeX \boxed{...} command.
2. The output is parsed into individual reasoning steps. A simple heuristic (step length >= 15 characters) is used to flag weak steps.
3. If weak steps are detected, a single re-prompt is issued with the flagged steps highlighted for targeted self-correction.
4. The final answer is extracted from the refined response and its correctness is evaluated using is_equiv().
5. All 500 questions are processed in parallel using a ThreadPoolExecutor with a limited number of workers to reduce overhead.
6. Two figures are generated:
   • Figure_1.png: A bar chart comparing the count of examples that required iterative correction vs. those that did not.
   • Figure_2.png: A line plot showing the cumulative accuracy progression as questions are processed.

IMPORTANT: This code assumes that the functions query_gpt4omini(prompt, system, temperature=...) and is_equiv(answer1, answer2) are available. The baseline performance of GPT-4o-mini on MATH500 is 70.2%; our method is designed to exceed that while ensuring non-zero accuracy.
