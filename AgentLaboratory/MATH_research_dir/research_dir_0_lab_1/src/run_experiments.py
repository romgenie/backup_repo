"""
This code implements the Dynamic Confidence-Weighted Multi-Scale Branching (DCMSB) prompting method for the MATH500 benchmark using gpt-4o-mini. 
The method decomposes the chain-of-thought into three dimensions (Numerical Precision, Logical Consistency, and Conceptual Coherence) and uses adaptive branching when any confidence is below the threshold of 0.8. 
It then recursively integrates the outputs from all branches to arrive at a final answer.

The code uses parallelized inference over all 500 test problems and reports overall accuracy. It also generates two colorful figures:
• Figure_1.png shows the distribution of aggregated confidence scores per problem.
• Figure_2.png shows the percentage of problems that triggered adaptive branching.

Note: The dataset-loading code is assumed to be present at the start as specified.

print('''Starting DCMSB experiment on MATH500.
This experiment demonstrates the multi-dimensional decomposition of numerical precision, logical consistency, and conceptual coherence.
For each problem, we prompt gpt-4o-mini to provide a detailed chain-of-thought along with a confidence vector.
If any confidence score falls below 0.8, adaptive branching is triggered: additional queries are run to generate alternative reasoning paths.
Then, a recursive meta-reasoning mechanism aggregates the outputs (by selecting the branch with the highest summed confidence) to produce the final answer.
The reported metrics include overall accuracy, the distribution of aggregated confidence scores, and the percentage of problems that triggered branching.
Results and colorful figures will be generated to showcase the experiment outcomes.
