Sample test question: {'problem': 'Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$', 'solution': 'We have that $r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3.$  Also, if we draw the line connecting the origin and $(0,3),$ this line makes an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ with the positive $x$-axis.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8 cm);\n\ndraw((-0.5,0)--(3.5,0));\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(0,3.5));\ndraw(arc((0,0),3,0,90),red,Arrow(6));\n\ndot((0,3), red);\nlabel("$(0,3)$", (0,3), W);\ndot((3,0), red);\n[/asy]\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are $\\boxed{\\left( 3, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)}.$', 'answer': '\\left( 3, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)', 'subject': 'Precalculus', 'level': 2, 'unique_id': 'test/precalculus/807.json'}
Starting DCMSB experiment on MATH500.
This experiment demonstrates the multi-dimensional decomposition of numerical precision, logical consistency, and conceptual coherence.
For each problem, we prompt gpt-4o-mini to provide a detailed chain-of-thought along with a confidence vector.
If any confidence score falls below 0.8, adaptive branching is triggered: additional queries are run to generate alternative reasoning paths.
Then, a recursive meta-reasoning mechanism aggregates the outputs (by selecting the branch with the highest summed confidence) to produce the final answer.
The reported metrics include overall accuracy, the distribution of aggregated confidence scores, and the percentage of problems that triggered branching.
Results and colorful figures will be generated to showcase the experiment outcomes.
