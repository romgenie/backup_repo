# DSPy ProgramOfThought Module

The `ProgramOfThought` module extends chain-of-thought reasoning with more structured programmatic elements.

## Basic Usage

```python
import dspy

# Define a signature for your task
class MathProblemSolver(dspy.Signature):
    """Solve math problems using a programmatic approach."""
    
    problem = dspy.InputField()
    solution = dspy.OutputField()

# Create a ProgramOfThought module
solver = dspy.ProgramOfThought(MathProblemSolver)

# Use the module
result = solver(problem="If 3x + 7 = 22, what is the value of x?")
print(f"Solution: {result.solution}")
```

## AI-Scientist Integration

ProgramOfThought is well-suited for AI-Scientist tasks that require structured reasoning and programming concepts:

1. **Experimental Design**: Creating structured experimental protocols
2. **Algorithm Development**: Developing new algorithms or modifications to existing ones
3. **Data Analysis**: Structured analysis of experimental results

### Example: NanoGPT Modification Designer

```python
import dspy

class NanoGPTModifier(dspy.Signature):
    """Design modifications to the NanoGPT architecture."""
    
    objective = dspy.InputField(desc="What we want to improve about NanoGPT")
    constraints = dspy.InputField(desc="Computational and other constraints")
    design = dspy.OutputField(desc="Detailed design of the modification")
    implementation_steps = dspy.OutputField(desc="Steps to implement the modification")

# Create a ProgramOfThought module
modifier = dspy.ProgramOfThought(NanoGPTModifier)

# Use the module
result = modifier(
    objective="Improve training efficiency while maintaining model quality",
    constraints="Must run on a single 16GB GPU. Cannot increase model parameters."
)
```
