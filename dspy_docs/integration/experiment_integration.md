# Integrating DSPy with AI-Scientist Experiments

This guide provides examples of how to integrate DSPy with AI-Scientist experiments.

## NanoGPT Experiments

NanoGPT experiments can benefit from DSPy's ability to optimize prompts and create more structured LLM interactions.

### Example: Enhancing Experiment Generation

```python
import dspy

# Define a signature for experiment generation
class ExperimentGenerator(dspy.Signature):
    """Generate experiments for a research idea."""
    
    idea = dspy.InputField(desc="The research idea to explore")
    context = dspy.InputField(desc="Background information and constraints")
    experiments = dspy.OutputField(desc="List of experiments to run")

# Create a module using Chain of Thought reasoning
generator = dspy.ChainOfThought(ExperimentGenerator)

# Integrate with AI-Scientist perform_experiments function
def enhanced_experiment_generation(idea_json):
    # Extract info from idea
    idea_desc = idea_json['description']
    context = f"Domain: {idea_json['domain']}\nConstraints: GPU memory limit of 16GB"
    
    # Generate experiments using DSPy
    result = generator(idea=idea_desc, context=context)
    
    # Convert to the format expected by perform_experiments
    # ...
    
    return experiments
```

## Optimizing the Experimental Process

You can use DSPy optimizers to improve the quality of experiment generation:

```python
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot

# Define a metric for evaluating experiment quality
def experiment_quality_metric(example, pred):
    # Implement your quality assessment logic
    # Return a score between 0 and 1
    return score

# Create training examples
trainset = [
    dspy.Example(
        idea="Improve language model training efficiency",
        context="Domain: NLP\nConstraints: GPU memory limit of 16GB",
        experiments="[...]"
    ),
    # Add more examples
]

# Optimize the generator
optimizer = BootstrapFewShot(metric=experiment_quality_metric)
optimized_generator = optimizer.compile(generator, trainset=trainset)
```
