# GUI Implementation Plans for Agents SDK

## Modules Ranked by Implementation Difficulty (Easiest to Hardest)

1. **Visualization Module**
   - Path: `/src/agents/extensions/visualization.py`
   - Already generates graphical representations of agent workflows using Graphviz
   - Can be easily embedded in a web interface

2. **SSE (Server-Sent Events) Implementation**
   - Path: `/examples/mcp/sse_example/`
   - Provides real-time communication foundation for GUI updates
   - Already demonstrates how to stream data from agents to clients

3. **Basic Agent Runner**
   - Path: `/src/agents/run.py`
   - Core functionality for executing agents
   - Simple interface for creating and running agents with results

4. **Streaming Text Components**
   - Path: `/examples/basic/stream_text.py`
   - Shows how to stream text output from agents
   - Essential for responsive UI updates

5. **Agent Configuration Interface**
   - Path: `/src/agents/agent.py`
   - Well-defined parameters that could be exposed in a form interface
   - Good documentation for creating UI controls

6. **Research Bot Manager**
   - Path: `/examples/research_bot/manager.py`
   - Demonstrates coordinating multiple agents
   - Has progress reporting that could be adapted for GUI

7. **MCP Server Integration**
   - Path: `/src/agents/mcp/server.py`
   - Provides the backend for tool execution
   - Would need adapting for web interface

8. **Tracing/Debugging Tools**
   - Path: `/src/agents/tracing/`
   - Powerful for visualizing agent behavior
   - Complex to represent visually but high value 

9. **Voice Pipeline Components**
   - Path: `/src/agents/voice/`
   - Adds speech capabilities for more interactive interfaces
   - Requires more complex audio handling in the UI

10. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
    - Complex workflows spanning multiple agents
    - Requires sophisticated UI for configuration and monitoring

11. **Guardrails Implementation**
    - Path: `/src/agents/guardrail.py`
    - Input/output validation that would need UI controls
    - More complex to visualize and configure
